        EdgeFarm is build for developers to support them in the development of complex IoT applications.
        By using EdgeFarm the developer can focus on the business logic only and does not have to worry about the infrastructure and the security of the application.
        `EdgeFarm` is a continuation of project `elbb`. `EdgeFarm` is a cloud-native edge computing platform. 
        It supports the deployment of edge applications and services on edge devices. It is based on Kubernetes and
        provides a set of tools to manage edge devices and applications.
        It contains the following components:
          - edgefarm.core: The core component of the EdgeFarm platform. It is responsible for the management of edge devices and applications.
          - edgefarm.applications: Allows the user to easily deploy workload to the edge devices.
          - edgefarm.network: Provides the running applications to transfer gathered sensor data to the cloud. The cloud can aggregate data from multiple edge devices and provide the data to the user.
          - edgefarm.monitor: Provides the user with a dashboard to monitor the status of the edge devices and applications as well the whole Kubernetes cluster.
